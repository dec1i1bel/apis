## Installation
- install php. project is being developed and tested with php 7.4. It doesn't work with php 8.
- enable CORS. On my CentOS 7 Apache [this tutorial](https://ubiq.co/tech-blog/enable-cors-apache-web-server/) works (this is not my blog and my article, I just it for help with installation). 
```
